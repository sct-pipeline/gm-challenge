# Spinal Cord Gray Matter Imaging Challenge
Spinal cord gray matter imaging challenge for the [5th Spinal Cord Workshop (June 22<sup>nd</sup> 2018, Paris)](http://www.spinalcordmri.org/2018/06/22/workshop.html).
The objective for this challenge is to propose a protocol that will generate the best image quality. For more details,
please see: https://goo.gl/2owcL7.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- [SCT v5.4](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/releases/tag/5.4)

## Getting started

Download the dataset of the challenge:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/sct-pipeline/gm-challenge-data.git
~~~

Download this repository and go in it:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/sct-pipeline/gm-challenge.git
cd gm-challenge
~~~

Create virtual environment, activate it and install package:
~~~
virtualenv venv  # You only need to run this once
source venv/bin/activate  # You need to run this everytime you with to process the data
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
~~~

Run (you need to have SCT installed):
```
sct_run_batch -script process_data.sh -jobs -1 -path-data <PATH_DATA> -path-output <PATH_OUT>
```

with:
- **<PATH_DATA>**: The path to the downloaded dataset
- **<PATH_OUT>**: The path where results will be output.

At the end of the processing, you can review:
- **<PATH_OUT>/log/**: Log files of the processing for each subject.
- **<PATH_OUT>/qc/index.html**: Quality Control report
- **<PATH_OUT>/results/results.csv**: CSV file containing the results. Example:

  |Subject|SNR_diff          |SNR_single        |Contrast          |
  |-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
  |9604   |17.955421557112000|15.036597989806800|0.1532358378597440|

## Description of the analysis

Two NIfTI files are required: an initial scan and a re-scan without repositioning. The analysis script `process_data.sh`
includes the following steps:

- Check if a mask for the spinal cord and/or gray matter (GM) already exists. If not, segment them automatically.
- Register the second scan to the first one. Use nearest-neighbour interpolation to preserve noise properties.
- Compute white matter (WM) mask by subtracting the spinal cord and the GM masks.
- Erode the WM mask to mitigate partial volume, yielding the WMe mask.
- Compute `SNR_diff` using the two-image subtraction method (Dietrich et al. J Magn Reson Imaging, 2007) in the WMe mask.
- Compute `SNR_single` using the first scan, by dividing the mean in the WMe mask and the STD in the WMe masks. 
- Compute `Contrast` by dividing the mean signal in the GM by that in the WM, on a slice-by-slice basis and then 
  average across slices.

## Analysis on the spine-generic dataset

A similar analysis can also be run on the spine-generic dataset. However, given that only one scan was available, 
SNR_diff could not be calculated. The command is similar to the one earlier, except the <PATH_DATA> should now point 
to the spine-generic multi-subject dataset:
~~~
sct_run_batch -script <PATH_REPOSITORY>/process_data.sh -path-data <PATH_DATA> -path-out <PATH_OUTPUT>
~~~

After running this script, figures can be generated as follows:
~~~
generate_figure_spinegeneric -ip <PATH_DATA>/participants.tsv -ir cd <PATH_OUT>/results/results.csv -o fig
~~~

## Simulations

Generate synthetic phantom of WM and GM that can be used to validate the proposed evaluation metrics. The phantoms are 
generated with random (Gaussian) noise, so running the script multiple times will not produce the same output.
This script is meant to be run twice in order to assess the metrics with the following functions. Example:
```bash
simu_create_phantom -o simu_phantom1
simu_create_phantom -o simu_phantom2
```

Once both sets of phantom data are generated, process these. The next script will look for CSV files, which are 
generated by `simu_create_phantom.py`, and which contain file names of the NIfTI phantom data:
````bash
simu_process_data -i simu_phantom1/ simu_phantom2/
````

Finally, make figures to assess metrics sensitivity to image quality across two smoothing values:
````bash
simu_make_figures -i simu_results/results_all.csv -s 0
simu_make_figures -i simu_results/results_all.csv -s 1
````
  
## Configuration of Niftyweb server

- make sure the script niftyweb/WMGM is declared in `PATH`
- add an entry to the crontab that points to the Daemon. Example (to edit, use `crontab -e`):
~~~
python niftyweb/setup/daemon_SOFTWEB_2files.py WMGM
~~~
